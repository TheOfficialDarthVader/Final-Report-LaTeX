@article{SacomanoFilho2019,
abstract = {A novel approach to accurately represent the carrier gas thermo-chemical properties of droplets evaporating in combustion environment is proposed and validated in the context of reduced capprhes. Numerical analyses of two of the most employed droplet evaporation models in computational fluid dynamiapplications and their subsequent impact on combustion processes are also performed. The study comprehends a systematic investigation of both models and different procedures used to address the relevant thermo-chemical properties for the evaporation modeling. Initially, investigations are addressed in a single droplet framework. Herein, available experimental data give support to the corresponding discussions. In a second part, both selected models and the simplification using air as carrier gas mixture are investigated in the context of flames propagating in droplets mists. A detailed chemistry model is used to represent the combustion of ethanol in air. A simplification strategy is subsequently investigated in terms of the relevant thermo-chemical properties for the evaporation modeling. The resulting strategy is successfully validated in a numerical context for flames propagating in droplet mists. Results aim to help the choice of methods employed for droplet evaporation modeling in a more general context. The methodology adopted in our analyses allows the assessment of each simplification and converges to an optimal combination of the studied methods.},

Effects of (1) blowing (evaporation), (2) variable fluid properties, (3) interdiffusion (binary diffusion with nonequal heat capacities), and (4) radiation are all included. A simple correlation which fits these stagnation point solutions within 3 percent is presented. Whole droplet heat transfer is shown to behave much like stagnation-point heat transfer when the Reynolds number is on the order of 100. Blowing and other high temperature effects on whole droplet heat and mass transfer can be estimated with stagnation point solutions. The ratio of stagnation point solutions with and without high temperature effects should multiply no-blowing constant-fluid-properties whole-droplet heat transfer correlations as a correction factor. Such a corrected whole-droplet correlation compares favorably with experimental data in the literature.}",
